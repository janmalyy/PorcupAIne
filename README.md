# PorcupAIne
A tool with webpage interface computing the "probability" of succes of a submitted project in Participating Budgeting in Brno (Czechia).
Created during the Advanced ML Methods course.
More info about the course can be found here: https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/phil/podzim2024/PLIN081

The API works. It does not return perfect results, the aim was to go through the whole project process, not to achieve the SoTA results.
A Presentation of the results in Czech can be found in `PorcupAIne_PROPEL_presentation.pdf` file.
